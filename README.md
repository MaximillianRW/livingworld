# [Living World Project (v. 0.0.0)](https://living-world-project.vercel.app/)

## About the Project
This project intends to deliver an open-source Text-Based Living World MMORPG Framework with PF2e based mechanics to the entire PF2e community worldwide.

Therefore, I intend to keep this work away from any company with prospect to charge, paywall, or implement P2W microtransactions features to profit over it.

To make it possible, I (and any colaborator that may work in this) open hand of any IP regarding the published source (put under AGPLv3 to avoid any abusive use in the present and future) and additional game mechanics developed to make this project viable (that will be kept under the ORC licence umbrella). All the other IPs rights will be kept in the contributors hands to be given usage permissions as they see fit (worldbuilding, lore, npcs, pictures, images and etc).

As such, this project depends exclusively on the community contributions to come alive, be it permitting me and contributors to focus more time and energy in this project besides subsisting or contracting/paying/buying external resourcers to flesh it out.

For reading this, I want to **THANK YOU** in advance for your interest and hope for any contribution you can make to help us make this project possible.


## About Me
I am a former back-end programmer, graduated in Physics with focus in systems simulations, and a rpg player and narrator for 20+ years.

I have also some experience with game modding and game architecture, and currently doing front-end courses to make this project possible.


## Intended 1.0v Release Features

- Character Creation and Level Up to 20 (with Pathbuilder and Pathfinder 2e Foundry json compatibilities);
- All Corebook systems implemented (Ancestries, Heritages, Classes, Feats, Creatures and etc);
- Multiplayer Online Party Management;
- Downtime management;
- Random Enconter Generator and Turn-Based combat;
- Simplified instance creation and exploration;
- Functional settlement and map system, with hexploration and adventuring;
- Automated settlement development through time, with factions, migrations and government changes;

- Ability for PCs to found their own settlements;
- Anything more that pop up as a necessary feature to make this framework complete.


## [Roadmap](/docs/Roadmap.md) (in development)

Each milestone in the roadmap is being thought to make it an entire functional game to be released step-by-step.

As the project progress a game will be instantied as a continuous playtest in which everyone will be able to participate, with number of simultaneous accesses just limited by the server I will be able to pay at the time.
